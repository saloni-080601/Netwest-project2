# Not Divisable subset.

1.First I created a function solveSubset

2 . Then I have taken  a user input for number of elements of list.

3 . Loop will iterate over the number of element given by user. 

4.we will take a user input name k for divideding the element of list.

5.we made a list .It contain zero element.
```python3
frequency=[0]*k
```
6.Now loop will iterate over the number of element of the list.

7 .It give the increment of number which the element of a number divisble by k.

8 .It return max number of element.
